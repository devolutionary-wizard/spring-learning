When choosing between Maven and Gradle, consider the following key factors:

1. **Build Tool Features**:

   - **Maven**: Follows "convention over configuration," making it easy for standard Java projects. It uses verbose XML for configuration.
   - **Gradle**: Offers flexibility with concise Groovy or Kotlin scripts and supports faster incremental builds.

2. **Project Complexity**:

   - **Maven**: Great for simple projects with straightforward setups.
   - **Gradle**: Handles complex, multi-module projects better with its customizable build logic.

3. **Performance**:

   - **Gradle**: Faster due to incremental builds and caching.
   - **Maven**: Rebuilds the entire project, often slower.

4. **Ecosystem**:
   Both have strong community support, but Maven's longer history means some plugins are more mature.

5. **Learning Curve**:
   - **Maven**: Easier for those familiar with XML.
   - **Gradle**: More flexible, but may require more time to learn, especially for scripting newcomers.

In conclusion, Maven is a solid choice for simpler, standard projects, while Gradle is better for complex, customizable builds. Choose based on your projectâ€™s complexity and your team's familiarity.
