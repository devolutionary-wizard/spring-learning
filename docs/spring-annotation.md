Spring Framework provides a wide range of annotations that help simplify development by reducing boilerplate code and enhancing readability. Hereâ€™s a list of some commonly used annotations in Spring:

- **Component Scanning:** Annotations like **@Component**, **@Service**, **@Repository**, and **@Controller** are used to mark classes as Spring components. These annotations allow Spring to automatically discover and register beans (components) during the application context initialization.
- **Dependency Injection:** Annotations like **@Autowired**, **@Inject**, and **@Resource** are used to inject dependencies into Spring-managed beans. This enables loose coupling and promotes easier testing and maintenance of the application.
- **Configuration:** Annotations such as **@Configuration**, **@Bean**, and **@PropertySource** are used to define configuration classes and beans explicitly. They provide an alternative to XML-based configuration and support Java-based configurations.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** Annotations like **@Aspect**, **@Before**, **@After**, **@Around**, and **@Pointcut** are used to implement aspects in AOP. These annotations help in separating cross-cutting concerns from the main business logic.
- **Controller Mapping:** Annotations in Spring MVC that map HTTP requests to handler methods include:
  - **@RequestMapping**: The primary annotation for mapping web requests to specific handler functions.
  - **@GetMapping**: Shorthand for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)`; used for handling HTTP GET requests.
  - **@PostMapping**: Shorthand for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)`; used for handling HTTP POST requests.
  - **@PutMapping**: Shorthand for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PUT)`; used for handling HTTP PUT requests.
  - **@DeleteMapping**: Shorthand for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.DELETE)`; used for handling HTTP DELETE requests.
  - **@PatchMapping**: Shorthand for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PATCH)`; used for handling HTTP PATCH requests.
  - **@RequestHeader**: Binds a method parameter to a specific HTTP header.
  - **@CookieValue**: Binds a method parameter to a specific cookie value.
  - **@ResponseStatus**: Specifies a custom HTTP status code to be returned by a method (e.g., `@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)`).
  - **@ResponseBody**: Indicates that the return value of a method should be written directly to the HTTP response body, commonly used in RESTful services.
  - **@ModelAttribute**: Binds a method parameter or return value to a named model attribute, accessible in the view.
  - **@SessionAttributes**: Specifies the names of attributes that should be stored in the session.
  - **@RequestPart**: Binds a method parameter to a part of a multipart request, often used for file uploads.
  - **@InitBinder**: Initializes a web data binder for a controller, allowing for custom data binding logic.
  - **@CrossOrigin**: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for a specific handler method or controller, allowing requests from different origins.
- **Transaction Management:** Annotations like **@Transactional** are used to manage transactions declaratively. They define the scope of a single database transaction.

Annotations in Spring significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write, improve readability, and make it easier to configure and manage your application's components and services. They are a core part of how Spring enables rapid development and dependency injection.
